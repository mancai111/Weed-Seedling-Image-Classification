# Weed-Seedling-Image-Classification
This project focuses on applying different Convolutional Neural Networks to distinguish the species of a seedling, and main problem is to figure out which CNN has the relatively best performance. The data is from an open-sourced Kaggle dataset with 960 plants from 12 species (4750 images in total).

Use transfer learning and try 7 different pre-trained models to see the effect of different pretrained model:
EfficientNetB0
MobileNet
ResNet50V2
inception_resnet_v2
VGG16
EfficientNetV2B2
EfficientNetV2S
